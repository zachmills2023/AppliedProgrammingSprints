## Overview

**JavaScript game/animations**:

**This is the prototype for a game in JavaScript and is just to demonstrate the animations.**:

**Make the project animate based on the selection that the user chooses from the drop down list.**:

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Get the HTML running
2. Get the JS and CSS running
3. Use WebStorm or LiveServer with VS Code to run the program

Instructions for using the software:

1. Because the program is just a prototype for the rest of the game, you will just need to select the animation that you would like to see from the drop down list. 
2. If you wanted to optimize the software, then you would need to use the object with the sprite sheet to animate the character based on the program logic and the user input. For example the character might jump and do the animations for the jump if the user were to press the SPACE key

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Download LiveServer if you're using Visual Studio Code or use webstorm
* Use a canvas element available in HTML5
* Use Javascript for most of the animations

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I would like to implement this animation style into my group project.
* [ ] I would like to make the animation move. 
* [ ] I would like to learn to make parallax backgrounds.
